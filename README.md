# React UI Task

### Pre-requisites

- Good hold on `HTML`, `CSS` and `JavaScript`.
- Some curiosity and wonder! :)

## Task

This task is divided into two parts. The first part involves learning the basics of how [React](https://reactjs.org) works. The second part will be about using what we learn in Part 1 to build a toy app!

### Part 1: React Basics (optional)

In Part 1, you will spend time with the [Intro to React](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html) tutorial on the official React website. It will take you through the basics of React while building tic-tac-toe!

_Note: while going through the tutorial, in the "Setup" section, make sure you choose [Option 2](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html#setup-option-2-local-development-environment)!_

### Part 2: UI Task

Part 2 is all about using what we learned in Part 1 and creating something from scratch! Here are the steps you'll need to follow:

1. Start a new React project on your local machine using the steps you learned in Part 1.
2. Your toy app will be a simple todo application. It should have the following features:
    - Ability to add a todo item
    - Ability to view created todos
    - Ability to mark a todo as done
    - Ability to mark done todos as not done
3. Send us a link to the project repo with your finished project, we will review your code and get back to you!

Note that:

- This toy todo app does not need to have any of database for saving todos (since this is a UI task!). For the task, it is totally fine to let the app reset on a page refresh.
- Your app will primarily be judged on it's functionality and the code you write.

### Part 2: Bonus!

If you are feeling extra adventurous and want to take your todo app to the next level, here are a few bonus features you could consider adding:

1. Ability to delete todos
2. A todo app that is truly yours ie. whip up some custom `CSS`!
3. Deploy your app on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com) for us (and the world) to use!

That's all! Good luck!
